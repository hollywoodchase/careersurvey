# KDC Careers

## Summary

KDC is an app aimed at teens and young adults to help them learn about possible career opportunities. 

Users should start by taking the career survey. This survey asks unique questions about the user's preferences in order to find a selection of jobs well suited for them. Each job listing contains detailed information (such as years of school, or rent you can afford) to help users determine if that career is a credible option for them. Users can then save jobs they are interested in to keep them in mind for the future.
